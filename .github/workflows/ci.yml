# Continuous integration: run on every push to main and on every PR targeting main.
#
# Steps:
#   1. go vet + go fmt check
#   2. golangci-lint
#   3. Unit tests (short mode — no envtest binary download, runs in < 60s)
#
# Integration tests that require envtest (etcd/kube-apiserver) are intentionally
# excluded here to keep CI fast; run `make test` locally or in a dedicated job.
